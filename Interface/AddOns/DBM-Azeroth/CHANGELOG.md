- Update localization.ru.lua (#227)  
- honor voice pack global disables by sound ID in the private aura object  
- Cleanup some minor warnings on namings  
- change option text since sound now configurable  
- fix alignment.

- update banned list

- Fixed a bug where the respawn timer fallback never actually started a respawn timer. Now it should start the default 29-30 second respawn timer on all bosses and then if it's wrong it'll be easier to get reports about it and fix.  
- prep new tags for wrath classic and retail  
- Ooh, fix a bug where vanilla onyxia is rejected on classic era. this culling only applies to wrath for now.  
- banned mods update  
- Update koKR (#221)  
- Update core for wrath culling  
- Prep core for culling phase 1  
- Default filter timers when using plater nameplate CD icon auras Add additional filter control for regular global timer disables for those not using plater who stll want to shut off specifically boss or trash timers only.  
- Update localization.ru.lua (#219)  
- Sync Bugfixes: - Fixed a bug where combat rules were applied globally to syncs, causing many trash mods, and boss RP syncs to never actually sync in first place, defeating entire purpose in many cases of why syncs exist in first place. This should fix MANY rp timers. caveat, it might also cause mods that aren't correctly checking IsInCombat in their OnSync handlers to start showing stuff out of combat (this has to be fixed on a per mod level) - Fixed a bug where player syncs were given no restriction on whether or not they should be trusted. There is a reason minsyncrevision exists and an out of date players DBM shouldn't be allowed to ignore that. This code originally existed so a player in a solo raid wouldn't have broken comms entirely, but that's now handled correctly in the sendSync function which automatically passes player comms to sync handler without check if there is no one else in group with them, so all the hacky exclusion checks in RecieveSync are no longer needed.

- add GTFO alert for inferno if not tank (or at least tank spec, if you're fury tanking, you'll get spammed, can't help that. turn alert off if you're non tank spec tanking)  
    Should help HC players die less on this boss  
- bump alpha  
- Fix a bug that caused cast announcements to use wrong cast time to appear if alert was using short text name (alternate spellID)  
- Change this function. it expects a string, so it should just explicitely refuse anything that's not one.
